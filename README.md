Star Trek Adventures: Captain's Log Assistant

# Project Aims
This project hopes to be an all-in-one solution to be able to run Captain's Log games. 
Heavily inspired from the likes of Stargzer for Ironsworn: Starforged (https://nboughton.uk/apps/stargazer/#/).

I hope to also include things from the other Star Trek Adventures source books, particularly Characters, Ships/Stations and Oracles.
Multi-language support is also intended.
I'll probably leave the styling nearer to the end but aim to replicate a style similar to LCARS.

Angular has been used just to be able to reach the widest possible audience over multiple device types and later intending to implement PWA functionality so users can install it and explore strange new worlds on the go.

# Contributing
If you'd like to help feel free to get in touch. I've been in touch with the Modiphius amd they are happy with the project so long as it remains free and does not use assets from the source books. If you want to do translations check out the en.json file and make an equivalent and let me know.

# Wishlist
Translations
Import/Export
Drawing scenes/maps
Adding more presets from all source books
Chained Oracles (one click mission generation etc...)
Factional theming (klingon/romulan looks etc...)
Quick actions on Character/Asset lists (Change categories, quick delete...)
Multiple Campaigns

# Known Issues
Opening the Rollbar though selecting character or asset attributes requires two clicks to close.

Qapla'!
